<p class="text-font"><u>History:</u></p>
<p class="text-font">* The Arabs were the first, to cultivate coffee and to begin its trade.  By </p>
<p class="text-font">the fifteenth century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by</p>
<p class="text-font"> the sixteenth century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria and Turkey.</p>
<p class="text-font">* Coffee was not only drunk in homes but also in the many public coffee houses  </p>
<p class="text-font">called &quot;qahveh khaneh&quot;  which began to appear in cities across the Near East. The </p>
<p class="text-font">popularity of the coffee houses was unequaled and people frequented them for all </p>
<p class="text-font">kinds of social activity. Not only did they drink coffee and engage in conversation, but</p>
<p class="text-font"> they also listened to music, watched performers, played chess and kept current on </p>
<p class="text-font">the news of the day.  In fact, they quickly became such an important center for the </p>
<p class="text-font">exchange of information that the coffee houses were often referred to as &quot;Schools of </p>
<p class="text-font">the Wise&quot;.</p>
